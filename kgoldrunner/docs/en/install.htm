</P>
If you can read this, you have probably already installed KGoldrunner.  This
section is to help you solve any problems you may have (e.g. with
missing files) and to document how installation should go.
<H3>Installation Steps</H3>
First check whether you are installing into the KDE 1 or KDE 2 desktop
(in KDE 2, the "Help, About KDE" menu option of many applications shows
the KDE version).  Now log in as the super-user "root" (or use "su root")
and set up a command-line window or Shell (e.g. "Konsole" or "Terminal").
<P>
Change to a suitable working directory and get the compressed
KGoldrunner software for KDE 1 or KDE 2 into it (file "kgoldrunner-V-kdeN.tgz",
where V is the KGoldrunner version number and N is 1 or 2).
<P>
Now enter the following commands:
<OL>
<LI>tar xvfz kgoldrunner-V-kdeN.tgz</LI>
<LI>cd kgoldrunner-V-kdeN</LI>
<LI>./configure</LI>
<LI>make init</LI>
<LI>make</LI>
<LI>make install</LI>
</OL>
Commands 1 and 2 uncompress the software and change to a directory where
you can run the other commands successfully.  Command 3 configures the
software to fit your system's directory structure, operating system,
compilers and other software (e.g. the Qt object and GUI library), then
generates all the "Makefile"s you will need for the "make" commands.
<P>
Command 4 adjusts the source code to compile correctly with Qt 1 or
Qt 2.  This step gets around a known problem with the Qt pre-processor
(the Meta-Object Compiler or MOC).
<P>
Command 5 compiles all
the source code and builds the "kgoldrunner" binary executable file
and command 6 copies that file, the documentation, the games and levels,
the icons and the KDE link file to their proper places in the KDE
directory structures.
<P>
You should now be able to run "kgoldrunner" as a command, to verify the
installation.  KGoldrunner does consistency checks when it starts and
will report any serious problems.
<H3>Menus and Desktop Icons</H3>
In KDE 1, you can find KGoldrunner on the KDE Games menu after
installation.  You may have to log out and in again to get it to
appear.
<P>
In KDE 2, you use the KDE "System, Menu Editor" menu option to
put KGoldrunner on the Games menu.  You should find the KGoldrunner icon
(a green figure and a bag of gold) in the list of available icons.
<P>
In KDE 1, the KGoldrunner icon appears on the desktop if you have a
copy of the file "KGoldrunner.kdelnk" in sub-directory "Desktop" of
your home directory.  You may have to log out and in again to get it
to appear.  In KDE 2, you need the file "KGoldrunner.desktop" in
sub-directory "KDesktop".  It is not clear how you use KDE to get the
file there, so just copy it from where it gets installed (i.e.
"/opt/kde/applnk/Games" or "/opt/kde2/applnk/Games").  To remove
the icon, right-click on it and use the popup menu.
<P>
You can get the KGoldrunner icon onto the "panel" at the bottom of
the screen just by using the mouse to drag a copy there from the
desktop.  Alternatively, you can use the facilities on the KDE menu
to add the icon to the panel.  To remove the icon, right-click on it
and use the popup menu.
<H3>Components of KGoldrunner</H3>
KGoldrunner has the following groups of components:
<UL>
<LI>Source files in C++ (*.cpp and *.h),</LI>
<LI>Image files for Play and Edit modes, in XPM format (*.xpm),</LI>
<LI>"Makefile"s used to compile, build and install KGoldrunner,</LI>
<LI>Configuration files (config* and others),</LI>
<LI>The KGoldrunner executable (kgoldrunner), desktop-link and icon files,
<LI>Data files to define games and store high scores (*.dat),</LI>
<LI>Level files (*.grl) in subdirectory "levels" to store levels of games,</LI>
<LI>This documentation's HTML-text and image files (*.htm and *.png),</LI>
<LI>Package documentation files (e.g. README).</LI>
</UL>
The first four groups will be used only if you are compiling and building
from source files.  The last five groups are typically what will be
installed as a "package" from a Linux distribution (e.g. from a SuSE Linux
distribution using YaST).
<H3>Flavours of KGoldrunner</H3>
KGoldrunner has been based on the KDE desktop and the Qt object
library.  Both of these changed substantially between their respective
versions 1 and 2.
<P>
There are thus two flavours of the KGoldrunner
executable file (kgoldrunner), one based on KDE1/Qt1 and the other based
on KDE2/Qt2, using completely different object code libraries and having
differently compiled source code.  The KDE1/Qt1 flavour will not work
in a KDE2/Qt2 environment and vice versa.
<P>
There are also two flavours of the desktop-link file, which links the icon
images to your desktop, the games menu and the KGoldrunner executable.  The
desktop-link files will not work in the wrong environment either.
<H3>Where Files are Installed</H3>
Apart from the executable and the desktop-link files, all files are the
same in the KDE1/Qt1 and KDE2/Qt2 environments, but they go in different
places.  The base directories used for installing packages are different
in KDE 1 and KDE 2 and the data and levels sub-directories KGoldrunner uses
are different too.
<P>
The base directory for KDE 1 applications is "/opt/kde" and for KDE 2 it
is "/opt/kde2".  Below that, they have similar sub-directories, as follows:
<UL>
<LI><B>bin</B> - Contains the KGoldrunner executable file (kgoldrunner).</LI>
<LI><B>share</B> - This is the base for other sub-directories.</LI>
<LI><B>share/applnk/Games</B> - Contains the KGoldrunner desktop-link
file ("kgoldrunner.kdelnk" for KDE 1 or "kgoldrunner.desktop" for KDE 2).</LI>
<LI><B>share/icons/kgoldrunner.xpm</B> - Contains the large (desktop) icon
for KGoldrunner in KDE 1.</LI>
<LI><B>share/icons/mini/kgoldrunner.xpm</B> - Contains the small (menu) icon
for KGoldrunner in KDE 1.</LI>
<LI><B>share/icons/locolor/32x32/apps/kgoldrunner.xpm</B> - Contains the large
(desktop) icon for KGoldrunner in KDE 2.</LI>
<LI><B>share/icons/locolor/16x16/apps/kgoldrunner.xpm</B> - Contains the small
(menu) icon for KGoldrunner in KDE 2.</LI>
<LI><B>share/apps/kgoldrun</B> - Contains the games data files
for KGoldrunner in KDE 1.</LI>
<LI><B>share/apps/kgoldrun/levels</B> - Contains the game levels files
for KGoldrunner in KDE 1.</LI>
<LI><B>share/apps/kgoldrun/system</B> - Contains the games data files
for KGoldrunner in KDE 2.</LI>
<LI><B>share/apps/kgoldrun/system/levels</B> - Contains the game levels
files for KGoldrunner in KDE 2.</LI>
<LI><B>share/doc/HTML/default/kgoldrunner</B> - Contains the default-language
(English) documentation and graphics files for KGoldrunner in KDE 1.</LI>
<LI><B>share/doc/HTML/en/kgoldrun</B> - Contains the
English documentation and graphics files for KGoldrunner in KDE 2.</LI>
</UL>
<H3>Working on KGoldrunner as a Developer</H3>
If you would like to work on the source code as a developer, please contact
the authors first, to make sure you have the latest versions (email
addresses are in the "Help, About KGoldrunner" menu option message).  Also,
have a look at the <A HREF="tech.htm">Technical Details</A> section of
this document.
