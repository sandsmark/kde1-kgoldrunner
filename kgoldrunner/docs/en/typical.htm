Below is a typical game in progress.  The hero (green) is at level 8 in
the Tutorial game.  He has 10 lives left and has scored 70,350 points (check
the window's status bar).  He started at the top left, dug a hole and
dropped into a line of false bricks and gold where you can now see him
falling.  The enemy above him will fall into the hole, then climb out
and be trapped up there till the end of the level.  He could cause the
hero some problems then, because that is where the hidden ladders appear
when all the gold is gone.  The hero has to use them to get to the
next level.  <A HREF="#more">More ...</A><A NAME="goback"></A>

The enemy on the right is falling and carrying some gold.  Notice his gold
outline.  The third enemy is coming down a ladder to chase the hero.  The
hero will have to dodge them both when he reaches the floor ...  This
level also shows diggable bricks and undiggable concrete and has lots of
traps (false bricks), which look just like ordinary bricks, but it has
no bars.  <A HREF="#goback">Back ...</A>
