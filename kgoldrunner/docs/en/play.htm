<H3>Starting the Game</H3>
When the KGoldrunner window appears, click on the name of one of the games
in the list displayed,
then click on the "Start Game" button.  Level 1 of the game you selected
will appear and the mouse pointer will be over the hero.  You start play
by moving the mouse, clicking the mouse or pressing any key (e.g. the
space bar), but avoid using K, S or Escape at this stage.  You start each
level in the same way.
<P>
You have five lives at the start and gain a bonus life for each level completed.
<H3>Moving Around</H3>
The hero moves towards wherever you place the mouse pointer.  If the mouse
pointer is above or below his level, he will always try to go up or down (e.g.
if there is a ladder available).  Otherwise he will move horizontally until he
is above, below or right under the mouse pointer.  You can make him follow
simple paths (like _ | L or U), but be careful not to get too many twists
and turns ahead of him.
<P>
You can move left or right over bricks, concrete, ladders or bars and up or
down over ladders.  If you are on an empty square or a gold nugget and there
is no brick, concrete, ladder or bar to hold you up, gravity takes over and
you fall.  You can also fall by moving down from a bar or the bottom of a
ladder, so keep the mouse pointer up there if you want to hold on!
<H3>Taking a Break</H3>
You can stop the game at any time by pressing the Escape key (Esc) <U>or</U>
clicking the "PAUSE" button in the menu bar (which then changes to
"Resume").  You restart by pressing the Escape key again <U>or</U> clicking
the "Resume" button.
<P>
<U>Hint:</U> When you use the KGoldrunner menu or do some work in another
window, <B>always</B> press the Escape key and stop the game.  Otherwise
the hero will go on following the mouse pointer and may get into trouble.
<P>
You can also save a game and continue it later, but ONLY when you are just
about to start a level.  Use the "S" key <U>or</U> use the Escape key and
then menu item "Game, Save Game".
<P>
Another way to take some pressure off is to adjust the game speed.  Use the
"Settings" menu (but press the Escape key first!).  You are cheating,
of course, if you lower the game speed when going for a high score.
<H3>Winning a Level</H3>
The object of the game is to collect all the gold, by moving or falling
onto it.  When there is none left, you must move to the top of the playing
area to get to the next level.  Often, as you collect the last piece of gold,
hidden ladders will appear and you can use them to climb to the top.
<H3>Beware of False Bricks</H3>
False bricks, otherwise known as fall-through bricks or traps, are the other
hidden feature of the game.  They look just like ordinary bricks, but if you
run over one you fall.  This can be bad if there is an enemy or a pit with no
exit down there, or good if there is some gold.
<H3>Enemies</H3>
Enemies move in very much the same way as the hero.  The main difference
is when they fall into a hole the hero has dug (see "Rules of Digging" below).
They will pick up gold either always or at random, depending on the game
settings, and will drop gold at random on brick, concrete or the top of
a ladder.  An enemy who is carrying gold has a gold outline.  You must get
the gold away from him before you can finish the level.
<P>
If an enemy touches you or you step down onto one, you die and must start
the level again, if you have any lives left.  However, you <U>can</U> walk
or stand on an enemy's head and you can ride an enemy down when he is
falling.  Some advanced levels <U>require</U> you to perform such a move.
<H3>Losing a Level</H3>
As explained above, you can lose a level and a life by touching an enemy.  You
can also lose by getting caught in a dug brick when it closes.  Otherwise
you can commit suicide by pressing key "K" or using menu item "Game, Kill
Hero".  Why would you want to do that?  Well, sometimes you can get trapped
in a place from which you cannot escape.  You will stay imprisoned for ever
unless you commit suicide!
<H3>The Importance of Digging</H3>
Digging is one of the most powerful tactics you have.  To dig a hole in a
brick to the left or right, just click the left or right mouse button.
<P>
You can dodge an oncoming enemy by digging a hole, waiting for him to fall
in and then running quickly over his head.  At the same time you can collect
any gold he was carrying.  Usually you can dig two holes to capture and run
over two enemies who are close together, but this rarely works if the
enemies are separated or there are more than two of them.
<P>
You can <U>kill</U> enemies by digging enough holes in their path.  It usually
takes two or more holes to kill one enemy and up to eight or more holes to
kill four or five.  When enemies die, they reappear immediately, either where
they started the level or near the top of the playing area, depending on
whether the game follows "KGoldrunner" or "Traditional" rules and settings
(see <A HREF="rules.htm">Scoring and Rules</A>).
<P>
Another way to escape an enemy or open a way through the maze is to dig
a hole and drop through the floor.  Finally, several levels contain
digging puzzles, in which you must dig through a sequence of bricks
to reach the gold, often with limited time available.
<H3>Rules of Digging</H3>
You click the left or right mouse button, to dig a hole to the left or right.
Only bricks can be dug, not anything else.  The hole will appear in the
floor on one side or the other (i.e. below and to the left or right of the
hero).  You can be running, standing or falling when you dig.  There must
be an empty grey space or hole above the brick (i.e. no digging
under a ladder, bar, gold, brick, concrete, false brick or enemy).
<P>
The hero can move in any direction through dug holes, including falling
right through a hole to escape an enemy.  After a short time, dug holes
close up, so you must use them quickly.  Plan your digging in advance.
There is no time to stop and think while you dig.
<P>
Enemies are always captured if they fall into a dug hole and will always
climb UP to get out of it.  Their time in the hole is less than the time the
hole stays open, so to kill enemies you usually have to dig several holes
in quick succession.  Enemies always give up gold as they fall into a hole,
so you can quickly run onto the enemy's head and grab the gold before he
climbs out.
<P>
Enemies will never fall down through a hole from above, but depending
on the game rules and "Settings", they can run horizontally into
a dug hole and not be captured and can fall from there or run into another
hole or run out of the hole.  Several levels that follow "Traditional" rules
depend on an enemy being able to run through a hole.
<H3>Winning and Losing the Game</H3>
You win by completing the last level in the game.  You lose when your
last life is gone.  Either way, if you have achieved one of the ten highest
scores for that game, you can record your achievement in the "KGoldrunner Hall
of Fame" ... :-) ...
