<H3>History and Acknowledgements</H3>
KGoldrunner is based on an early computer game called Lode Runner (TM)
which was written in the USA by Doug Smith and first released in 1983.  It
appeared originally on the Apple II and Commodore 64 computers, which was
where the Wadham family and Marco Krüger fell in love with it.  You can
find out more about Lode Runner and the various versions that have come out
since 1983, on the website
<A HREF="http://entropymine,com/jason/lr">Jason's Lode Runner Archive (http://entropymine,com/jason/lr/)</A>.
That site also has the story of Lode Runner's original development in the file
"misc/ldhist.html".
<P>
KGoldrunner is an attempt to preserve the spirit of the original classic game
on a platform that will be portable and will last more than a few years.
It is available as free software in source code form.  Copies of the original
game are unobtainable now and the machines it ran on are going into museums.
<P>
Marco Krüger developed KGoldrunner as far as v0.3, out of nostalgia
for the original
Commodore 64 game.  Ian Wadham added several features and levels to make it
v1.0.  Ian's son Peter composed the 100 levels in the "Peter W Initiation"
game and the 20 tricky levels in "Vengeance of Peter W".  The other levels
were composed by Ian, Peter, Marco Krüger and friends and Ian's other
children, Simon and Genevieve.
<H3>Platforms, Versions and Portability</H3>
The first versions of KGoldrunner are based on the Linux operating system
and IBM PC compatible machines, using the KDE 1 or KDE 2 desktop.
<P>
KGoldrunner is written in C++, using Linux and the free-software version
of the portable Qt object and GUI library.  It was developed under
SuSE Linux 6.3 and 7.2.  KGoldrunner v1.0 compiles
and runs either with KDE 1 and Qt 1 <U>or</U> with KDE 2 and Qt 2.
<P>
The Qt 2 version of KGoldrunner is intended to be almost independent
of the operating system and desktop.  This means it should be fairly
easy to port KGoldrunner to other operating systems, such as Windows
and Macintosh, because the Qt 2 library and C++ language are portable
to other operating systems and the KGoldrunner source code is available.
<P>
If you are interested in porting KGoldrunner, see the sections on
Installation and Technical Details at the end of this documentation,
but please contact one of the KGoldrunner authors before you start, just
to make sure you are up-to-date with any recent work.
