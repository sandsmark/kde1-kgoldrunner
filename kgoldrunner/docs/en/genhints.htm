<H3>Dealing with Enemies</H3>
<UL>
<LI>You can always trap a single oncoming enemy in one hole, get his gold
and run on over him without killing him.  It is often a good idea to dig
behind you and delay him further, but that might kill him.  In some
levels it is not a good idea to kill enemies.</LI>
<LI>You can usually trap two oncoming enemies in two holes, get their gold
and run on over them, but this is dangerous if the enemies are separated
by two or three spaces.  Sometimes two holes kill one of the enemies and
the other escapes and sometimes both escape.</LI>
<LI>It is nearly always impossible to trap three oncoming enemies and run
on over them.  You will have to kill them, dig and drop through the floor or
simply run away.</LI>
<LI>Try to get all the enemies running together in one group.  That way
you will not get surrounded and you can do such fun things as collect gold
while they run along behind you.</LI>
<LI>Sometimes you can kill an enemy with two holes, but it often takes
three to nine holes to kill one to five enemies.</LI>
<LI>It is possible to kill an enemy with <U>one</U> hole if he is far
enough away when you dig it.</LI>
<LI>In the Traditional game, you can trap an enemy permanently in a
pit of brick or concrete.  Stand near the edge of the pit on the opposite
side to the enemy.  As he approaches the pit, move down one square (to
the level of the floor of the pit) and the enemy will usually run into
the pit.</LI>
<LI>In some levels in the Traditional game, you can force an enemy to
climb a ladder ahead of you if you stand somewhere above the bottom of
the ladder.</LI>
</UL>
<H3>Digging for Gold</H3>
<UL>
<LI>To dig through more than one layer of bricks, start by digging as
many bricks as there are layers, jump in, dig one brick less and so on.</LI>
<LI>If you dig next to a ladder or a succession of bars, you can dig
down through <U>any</U> number of layers and up to five or six bricks
horizontally.  Just return to the ladder or bars after digging each
layer, then move down one square, run out and dig the next layer.</LI>
<LI>If a digging puzzle looks impossible, consider that there might
be some false bricks in it.  Maybe the last layer is false or maybe
you can stand in a false brick and dig next to it.</LI>
<LI>If you cannot get to a piece of gold, think about getting an
enemy to go there and get it.  Even think about using an enemy's
head as a bridge to get across a pit or precipice.</LI>
<LI>Think about the <U>order</U> in which you will collect the gold.  If
you pick the right order, the digging might be easier.</LI>
<LI>Some levels require you to dig away a
brick walll, run in, collect some gold and run out again before
the bricks close up and trap you.</LI>
</UL>
<H3>Tricks with Gold</H3>
<UL>
<LI>In some levels there is a nugget that must be collected last of
all, because you will need the hidden ladders to get away from that
position.</LI>
<LI>In some situations an enemy can be killed without giving up the
gold he is carrying.  The gold becomes a "lost nugget".  You score
no points for making an enemy lose a nugget, but at least you
can finish the level.</LI>
<LI>If there is nowhere to dig, keep the enemies running over concrete and
the tops of ladders and so make them release their gold at random.</LI>
</UL>
<H3>Solving Difficult Levels</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Change the speed settings to Novice, Beginner or even lower.</LI>
<LI>Use the Editor feature to "peek" at where the false bricks and hidden
ladders are.</LI>
<LI>Use the Editor feature to save the level in one of your own games, then
you can edit it so that you do not always have to start at the beginning
when you die.  This allows you to develop the solution in easier stages.</LI>
<LI>In digging puzzles, look for false bricks you can fall into and
thus have one less brick to dig.  Or consider using an enemy to go ahead
of you, so that you can stand on his head and dig.</LI>
<LI>Look for a theme or "trick" in the level, such as riding down on an
enemy's head, trapping all the enemies in a pit, luring the enemies to a
corner where they will stay and not chase you, luring the enemies into
pits you must cross to get to some gold, getting the enemies to fetch
gold for you or finding spots where you can stand and make an enemy
move where you want him.</LI>
