<H3>The Menus and the PAUSE-Resume Button</H3>
In the menu bar there are four menus, as well as the all-important
PAUSE-Resume button.  You need this button to stop game play while you
access the menus or work in another window, though it is better to use
the Escape (Esc) key as a short-cut.  That way the action will stop
immediately and the hero will not go astray as you move the mouse up
to the menu bar.
<P>
The four menus are described in outline below.  Details of all the options
follow in a separate section on each menu: see
<A HREF="#gameMenu">The Game Menu</A>,
<A HREF="#settingsMenu">The Settings Menu</A>,
<A HREF="#editorMenu">The Editor Menu</A> or
<A HREF="#helpMenu">The KDE 2 Help Menu</A>.
<P>
Many of the menu options also refer to and depend on
<A HREF="select.htm">the Level Selection Dialog</A> box.
<UL>
<LI><B>Game:</B>  This menu contains options affecting game play, such as
starting and finishing games, saving games, loading saved games,
showing high scores and getting a hint (if available).
<P>
The Game Menu also contains the "Quit" option and an option to start
the Tutorial game without going through the level selection dialog.  You
can also quit by clicking the "X" at the top right of the KGoldrunner
window.
<P>
For those who look for a "File" menu in this position, there is an
extra copy of "Save Edits".
<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>Settings:</B>  This menu has three groups of settings: the choice
of KGoldrunner or Traditional playing rules (see
<A HREF="rules.htm">Scoring and Rules</A>), the detailed list
of playing options and lastly the game-speed options.  The current
selections are ticked (or "checked", as the Americans say).  The settings
are automatically selected when you start playing, but you can use this
menu to vary them if you wish.
<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>Editor:</B>  This menu has everything you need to create your own
games and levels and maintain them, including features to help you re-order
levels or move them between games or to delete them when no longer
needed.  When you re-organize your levels, the level numbers in a
game remain consecutive (no gaps) and the levels are automatically
re-numbered.
<P>
When you are using the Game Editor a graphical toolbar with tool tip
text appears under the menu bar.  See
<A HREF="editor.htm">the Game Editor</A> for more details of how to create
and edit KGoldrunner levels.
<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>Help:</B> In the KDE 2 version of KGoldrunner, the Help menu
contains an option to start the Tutorial game, an option to get a hint
(if available), access to the User's Guide (this document),
About KGoldrunner and About Qt Toolkit.
<P>
In the KDE 1 version , this menu is the standard KDE 1 Help menu,
containing Contents (this document, the User's Guide), About KGoldrunner
and About KDE.
<P>
If you would like to report a problem or you have some new levels to
contribute, our email addresses are in the "About KGoldrunner" message.

</UL>
<H3><A NAME="gameMenu">The Game Menu</A></H3>
<UL>
<LI><B>Start Game:</B>  Shows the level selection dialog box, where
you choose a game to start (at level 1).</LI>
<LI><B>Play Any Level:</B>  Shows the level selection dialog box, where
you choose a game and level to play.</LI>
<LI><B>Play Next:</B>  Shows the level selection dialog box with the game
and level set to one more than previously.  You can then choose to play that
level or another.</LI>
<LI><B>Kill Hero (K):</B>  Kills the hero when he is in a position from
which he cannot escape.  Key K is a short-cut.</LI>
<LI><B>Start Tutorial:</B>  Starts the tutorial game, without going through
the level selection dialog.  At the start of each level there is a text
message telling you what to do.</LI>
<LI><B>Get a Hint / NO Hint:</B>  If the current level has a hint, this option
says "Get a Hint" and pops up a hint message when you select it.  It says
"NO Hint" if there is none.  If you then select it, the message tells you
yet again that there is no hint for this level.</LI>
<LI><B>Load Game:</B>  Brings up a table of previously saved games,
sorted with the latest first.  Each line lists the game, level, number
of lives, score, day of week, date and time.  If you select a line and
click the OK button, that game starts at the beginning of that level
and with the same lives and score you had when you saved it.</LI>
<LI><B>Save Game (S):</B>  Saves the current game, level, lives and
score.  The option is <U>only</U> available when you are just about to
start a level.  At other times it gives you a warning message.  Before
using this option, you must press Escape (Esc) to prevent the game
from starting as you move the mouse, but it is much easier to
use the S key as a short-cut.</LI>
<LI><B>Show High Scores:</B>  Shows a table of up to ten high scores for
the currently selected game.  Each line shows the player's rank and name,
the level reached, the score achieved, the day of the week and the date.</LI>
<LI><B>Save Edits:</B>  This option is enabled only if you have been using
the Game Editor.  It brings up the level selection dialog box and lets you
choose a level number and game in which to save your work.  Its action is
exactly the same as the Save Level option on the Editor menu and the disk
icon on the edit toolbar.</LI>
<LI><B>Quit:</B>  Terminates KGoldrunner immediately.  If a game is in
progress, it disappears forever (unless you have just saved it) and there
is no check for a high score.  If you were editing a level, you are given
an opportunity to save your work.
<P>
You can also quit by clicking the "X" at the top right of the KGoldrunner
window, with the same opportunity to save edits.

the game and the level number to move a level to another game <U>or</U>
