This is the level selection dialog box.  It appears when the game starts and
also when you select options from the Game or Editor menus.  You use it to
choose a game and a level to play, edit, save, move or delete.
<P>
The button at the bottom left is the "OK" or "action" button.  Its label
changes according to what you are doing: in this case starting a game.
<P>
There are several "System" games that come with the KGoldrunner release.  Their
names appear in the list box.  If you have composed a game and levels yourself,
using the Editor, you can see them by changing the Owner option to "User".
<P>
To select one of the games in the list, just click on its name.

<H3>Game Details</H3>
When you select a game, the dialog automatically shows what rule settings
apply (see <A HREF="rules.htm">Scoring and Rules</A>) and how many levels
there are.  The "More ..." button shows you further information about the
game.
<H3>Selecting a Level</H3>
In this example the level is fixed at "001", because you are starting a
game.  In other cases you can choose a level and the default number will
be something reasonable, such as the last level you played or edited.
<P>
You can select a level either by typing it in or by moving the slider.  The
arrows at the end increase or decrease the number by one.  Also you can drag
the slider with the left mouse button held down and change the number
rapidly <U>or</U> you can change it by 10 if you click in the space to the
right or left of the slider.
<P>
As the level number changes, a preview of the level appears in the small
window on the right and the level's name (if it has one) appears below
the slider.
<H3>Completing your Selection</H3>
When you have chosen a game and a level, just click the button at the
bottom left to proceed with your edit or play.
<P>
Until you do that, nothing changes, so if you prefer you can click
"Cancel" and go back to what you were doing earlier.  Note that the game
action is frozen while this dialog box appears, so you can continue
playing where you left off if you choose "Cancel".
<H3>Saving Changes</H3>
If you select an action on the Game or Editor menu and you were previously
editing and had not saved your changes, you will get a message asking you to
save, abandon or continue your work.  The level selection dialog box will
not appear until you have safely disposed of your previous work.
<H3>Playing or Editing "Any" Level</H3>
Note that the menus allow you to select and play or edit <U>any</U>
level.  If you start a game after level 1, that is OK, you will just
not get such a high score.  Dedicated players often prefer to play
high-numbered levels for fun, rather than go for a high score.
<P>
If you select a System level for editing, that is OK too, but you must save
it in one of your own games <U>not</U> back in the System game.  If it is a
very difficult level, you might want to change it so that you don't go
back to the start of the level every time you die.
<P>
To see what this means, try "Wadham Family Challenge", level 16, "The
Three Musketeers".  That level has about ten difficult puzzles in it.
