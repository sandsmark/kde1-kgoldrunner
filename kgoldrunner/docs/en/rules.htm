<H3>Rules and Settings</H3>
Most of the rules of KGoldrunner are covered in the section
<A HREF="play.htm">How to Play</A>, however there are two major rule settings
that affect the style of play: known as "KGoldrunner" and "Traditional".  It
is important to know which settings are in force when you are playing a
game.  Many Traditional levels are impossible with KGoldrunner
settings.  Most KGoldrunner levels are easier with Traditional settings,
but the Traditional games are no pushover.  To make life easier, KGoldrunner
automatically chooses the correct settings for a game when you go into it,
but you can can change them if you wish.
<P>
The main difference between KGoldrunner and Traditional settings is the
method by which the enemies choose a path to the hero.
<UL>
<LI>
In the Traditional search method, enemies look for vertical paths and try
to stay above the hero or at the same height.  They go below him only as a
last resort.  The enemies make no attempt to get close to the hero in the
horizontal direction until they are at the same level and can find a
horizontal path.  This leads to situations where you can "control" enemies
who are far away from you and make them work for you or at least keep
out of your hair.</LI>
<LI>
The KGoldrunner method searches alternately for horizontal and vertical
paths, which tends to keep the enemies over your side of the playing
area and at about the same height (i.e. they are more aggressive and not so
easy to manipulate).</LI>
</UL>
The other differences are listed below.  All are selectable on the "Settings"
menu and so is the search strategy.
<UL>
<LI>
In KGoldrunner play the enemies and hero always move at the same speed
and bricks always take the same time to close.  In Traditional play the game
speed depends on the number of enemies in a level.  The more enemies, the
slower they run.  The hero also becomes slower, but not so noticeably.</LI>
<LI>
In Traditional play enemies always collect gold nuggets when they run
into them.  In KGoldrunner play it is a random choice.  The enemies drop
nuggets after a random time in both types of play.</LI>
<LI>
Enemies can run sideways through holes in Traditional play but not
in KGoldrunner play.  Several Traditional levels depend on being able
to release an enemy from behind a brick wall.</LI>
<LI>
When enemies die in KGoldrunner play, they go back to where they
started the level.  In Traditional play, they reappear at a random place
near the top of the playing area.  This makes a big difference, especially
in levels where you have to get enemies to fetch nuggets down for you.</LI>
