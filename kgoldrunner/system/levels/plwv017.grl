Where's the Roof?
First clear up all the gold at the left and top, then dig out the cave and collect the gold on the ladders between the two low walls of false brick.

If there is an enemy in that section, kill him by hiding in the bottom of a false wall and digging one hole next to it.  He will die as he attempts to get you.  This won't work if there is gold on the brick you want to dig .....
