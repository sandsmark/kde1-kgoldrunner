Hi !!
Hi !  Welcome to KGoldrunner !  The idea of the game is to pick up all the gold nuggets, then climb to the top of the playing area and move up to the next level.  A hidden ladder will appear as you collect the last nugget.

The hero (the green figure) is your deputy.  To collect the nuggets, just point the mouse where you want him to go.  At first gravity takes over and he falls ...
