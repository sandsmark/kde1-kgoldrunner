Under the Stairs
Start by killing the enemies.  When they fall into the space at the right, move down and to the left to get them to drop further in and stop them getting the gold.  If they go more than one third of the way in, they will be premanently trapped.

Now tackle the three dig-and-run puzzles.  You may have to make several trips to empty an area.  Finally, collect the rightmost nugget.
