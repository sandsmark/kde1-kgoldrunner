Pharaoh's Tomb
Finish by collecting the two nuggets either side of a ladder on the left, then the four at the very bottom of the tomb.  You need to get an enemy to fall onto the hanging nugget in the left side of the pyramid.  You need another to fill the pit at bottom left.

The rest is several digging puzzles, often with limited time to get out before your escape route closes.  Enjoy!
