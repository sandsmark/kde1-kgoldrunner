Head Case
This is a warmup for a later level.  To get the gold at the right, descend onto the enemy's head, release him to the left, move left after him and, as you ride down on his head, dig right.  You can then run in, get the gold and exit before the brick closes.

If you move to the bottom right corner, you can get the enemy to fall into the hole containing gold.
