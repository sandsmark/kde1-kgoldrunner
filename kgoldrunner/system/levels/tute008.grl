Traps
Some of the bricks here are not what they seem.  They are known as false bricks, fall-through bricks or traps.  If you try to walk on them, you fall through.  If the enemies walk on them, they can descend on you without warning.  Sometimes you have to fall through a brick to get some gold.

At the start, jump into the concrete pit, dig and drop through.  That will get one enemy tied up for a while .... :-)
