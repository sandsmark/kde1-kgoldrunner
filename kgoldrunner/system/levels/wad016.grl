The Three Musketeers
You have to kill all three Musketeers, so that they fill the false bricks under the gap in the bars at the top.  Ignore d'Artagnan at the bottom right.  You only walk over him to get a nugget.

Collect the gold left to right across the bottom of the play area, then right to left across the top.  Be sure to leave the nugget left of centre on the concrete.  Collect that one last.

Before you do so, dig away a row of three bricks above and to the left of it, then exit to the next level along roughly the same route as you used earlier.
