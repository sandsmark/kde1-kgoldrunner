Rat Trap
Move ultra-quickly to trap the two enemies and run over them.  If you wait till they are almost touching you, they may both survive, then you can run up and around to the bottom right, descend the ladder to the concrete and trap them permanently in the nearby pit.

If one gets stuck in the tower structure, use the same trick.  There are false bricks in the bottom of the tower.  If one is trapped and still has some gold, dig one hole at the right hand end of the pit, go back down the ladder and lead the enemy to his death, whereupon the gold will be destroyed.
