Sticky Ladders
Start by going about three quarters the way up the ladder.  The enemies run right.  Run to the top in time to get one to fall through a false brick while the others run towards you.  Go left, dig two holes to trap them, then run right, dig and fall to the bottom of the first small ladder on the right.  The enemies should come down the long ladder and fill up the two false bricks at its foot.

Dig and catch the third enemy on top of the thick brick area, then run to the second space from the bottom of the long ladder, next to a row of bricks.  The enemy should run into the pits on the left.
