Hair's Breadth Timing
At top centre dig two bricks.  As they re-appear, dig two more, run across the top and dig next to the short ladder.  Drop in and collect the gold.  You have no time to spare!

Clear the bottom left last.  To go right, fall into a false brick under a short ladder, then climb along just under the concrete.

In the middle of the right hand side, stand under the right hand bar next to the hole, dig left, drop into a false brick, then dig twice more, moving down and left.  Lastly, stand on the short ladder, dig your escape brick on the right, run like mad round to the hole, drop in, collect the gold, fall through some bricks and dig again to escape.
