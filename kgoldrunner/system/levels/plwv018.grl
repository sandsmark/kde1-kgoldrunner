After collecting all the gold on the left, stay over there, go up high, get the enemy to follow you, then drop to the floor.  If an enemy falls near the middle ladder on the right, quickly climb to a point higher than that ladder.  After a few tries, you should get all three enemies at the right onto the long rightmost ladder.  Now it is easy to clear out the first two areas of gold on the right.

Attract three or maybe only two enemies onto the middle ladder at the right.  Go up near the hole in the concrete, drop, run right, go up the long ladder, drop left and collect the gold.

If you get only two enemies onto the middle ladder, make sure the third one is dropping off the right ladder before you run across.  You will then have to go all the way up the long ladder and wait till it is safe to drop left and collect the gold.

If the enemies are still carrying gold, keep them chasing you around on the middle ladder and falling to the concrete until they release it.
