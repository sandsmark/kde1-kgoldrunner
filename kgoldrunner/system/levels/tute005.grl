Bars and Ladders
There's nowhere to dig, so you must dodge the enemies and avoid falling to the concrete at the wrong time.  Try to keep the enemies together.

If an enemy has a gold outline, he is holding a nugget.  He might drop it as he runs over the concrete or maybe at the top of a ladder ...... patience, patience !!
