Navigation
This is an exercise in moving around.  Follow the track of gold nuggets until the ladder pops up at the right.  The hero can only follow the mouse along simple paths (like _ | L or U), so be careful not to get too far ahead of him.

DANGER: Try not to fall off the ladder or bar into the concrete pit at the bottom right.  If you do get trapped there, the only way out is to kill the hero (press key "k") and start the level again.
