You Have ENEMIES !!!
Well, it's been nice and easy up to now, but the game would be no fun without enemies.  They are after the gold too: worse still they are after you!  You die if they catch you, but maybe you will have a few lives left and can start again.

You can handle enemies by running away, digging a hole or luring them into part of the playing area where they get stranded.

If an enemy falls into a hole, he gives up any gold he is carrying, then gets stuck in the hole for a time and climbs out.  If the hole closes while he is in it, he dies and reappears somewhere else on the screen.  You can deliberately kill enemies by digging several holes in a row.

More importantly, you can run over an enemy's head.  You must do that right at the start of this level.  Dig a hole, trap the enemy, wait for him to fall all the way in, then run over him, with the other enemy in hot pursuit .....
